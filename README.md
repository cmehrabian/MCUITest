### Congratulations!

You’ve been commissioned to build DoveBox: a user interface for our latest flock of doves. Our Space Captains will use DoveBox to control the doves (which are actually Earth-imaging satellites, not birds) in orbit. We’ve provided our advanced API and database to help you get started.

### Implement a React application that does the following:

* Displays a table of Doves on pageload, populated by the API
* Has a Search component(s) to query the API for Doves based on their properties, and displays results in the table above-mentioned table.
* Has a form to add new Doves to the database

### Guidelines

You should use a flux-like architecture for managing state. Clone this repo and run `npm install` in the root directory to install our [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) npm package. (Note: you do not need to install JSON-server separately!) Run `npm start` to initialize the dummy API server. While it's running, you can access the API via `localhost:3000`. 

Extend the application any way you see fit.

To submit your app email us at: mcui@planet.com with a link to your repo. If you have questions or issues with the test, please let us know.

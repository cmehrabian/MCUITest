Congratulations! You’ve been commissioned to create DoveWatcher.com , a new interface for our latest flock of doves. Our Space Captains will use DoveWatcher to control the doves (which are actually Earth-imaging satellites) in orbit. We’ve provided our advanced API and database to help you get started.

Implement a React application that does the following:

* Displays a table of Doves
* Has a Search component or components to query the database for Doves based on their properties
* Has a form to add new Doves

You should use a flux-like architecture for managing state. Use the included db.json and the JSON-server npm package. Extend the application any way you see fit, or talk about potential extensions.
